Create collections [scenes] of test cases [scenarios]  

Selenium-Harness provides a web interface to manage automated UI testing, leveraging Selenium + PhantomJS + GhostDriver  

Individual tests, or scenarios, can be executed or added to a scene for group execution.  

Currently the output is printed to the screen, but more API functions will be added soon, for integration with other systems, such as Jenkins for continous integration.  

With some modification, this may also prove useful for an automated monitoring platform with integration endpoints for systems like Bosun or Grafana
